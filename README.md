## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a minimalist yet fully responsive web page structure. It demonstrates the ease of creating adaptive user interfaces using the utility-first classes of Tailwind CSS directly within a single HTML file, making it highly portable and easy to deploy.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Leverages Tailwind's utility classes for rapid and consistent styling.
-   **Single-File Application**: All core code contained within `index.html` for simplicity.
-   **Modern UI Elements**: Includes a responsive header, hero section, content cards, and footer.
-   **Lightweight**: No heavy frameworks or complex build processes required.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Via CDN for styling and responsive layout.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript**: A small snippet for mobile menu toggling.
